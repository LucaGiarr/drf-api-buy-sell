## Bugs

### Fixed bugs

#### Error "Cannot read properties of null" when creating an advert

- **Fix** With the help of a Code Institute tutor, we write the code to check if there was an image to append before trying to appending it. If there was no image, a "default~" image was appended from the API.

#### Error 400 (Bad Request) when sending the form for editing the profile image or email

- **Fix** I allowend the image and the email to be "blank" in the Profile model.

### Unfixed bugs

Currently there are no known unfixed bugs.
