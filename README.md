## Design

### Colour Scheme

Colour palette from Coolors.

![Colour Palette](docs/readme_images/palette_colours.png)

All pages feature a background color of "Seasalt," a refined shade of grey that harmonizes with the "Azure" hue used in the navigation bar. The navigation links, displayed in white, transform into a "Dark Orange" shade upon hovering, aligning seamlessly with the website logo in the NavBar.

For a clean and organized look, the details of cars for sale and messages are presented in white boxes. This design choice ensures a clear and aesthetically pleasing layout throughout the website.

In general, the colors used were chosen to transmit calmness, and modernity and give a good contrast between the background and the text at all times.

### Imagery

All images other than the logo will be uploaded by the user.

If the user does not choose an image when creating an advert (or editing an advert), a placeholder image will be used.

### Fonts

The Roboto font is used for the whole website to have consistency in the text.

Sans Serif is the backup font, in case the main font is not imported correctly.

### Wireframes

Wireframes, drawn using Microsoft PowerPoint, were created for mobile, tablet and desktop.

Wireframes for tablet are the same as per mobile.

#### Desktop

## Agile Methodology

Github projects was used in the development process of the project using the agile approach.
Link to project board [here](https://github.com/users/LucaGiarr/projects/3)

## Data Model

### Project Overview:
The project adheres to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and uses the Django framework for web development. The user authentication system is implemented using Django AllAuth, providing secure and customizable authentication features.

### Car Model:
The custom `Car` model is designed to enable users to create and manage car advertisements. It includes several attributes, each representing a database field. Key attributes include:
- `car_title`: Title of the car advertisement.
- `make`, `model`, `year`: Details about the car's make, model, and year of manufacture.
- `condition`: Represents the condition of the car (New or Used).
- `kilometers`, `engine`, `transmission`, `body_style`, `doors`, `fuel_type`, `color`: Specific details about the car's specifications.
- `price`: Indicates the asking price for the car.
- `city`: Specifies the city where the car is located.
- `description`: Allows for a detailed description of the car.
- `car_photo`, `car_photo_1` to `car_photo_4`: Images providing a visual representation of the car.
- `created_on`: Timestamp indicating when the car listing was created.
- `owner`: Foreign key referencing the `User` model, establishing a relationship between the car advertisement and its owner.

### Message Model:
The `Message` model facilitates communication between users regarding specific car listings. Key attributes include:
- `sender`, `receiver`: Foreign keys linking to the `User` model, representing the sender and receiver of the message.
- `content`: The textual content of the message.
- `timestamp`: Timestamp indicating when the message was sent.
- `car_id`: Foreign key linking to the `Car` model, associating the message with a specific car listing.

### UserProfile Model:
The `UserProfile` model is introduced to store comprehensive user information. It has a OneToOne relationship with the `User` model (provided by AllAuth), ensuring a one-to-one correspondence between users and their profiles. At the current stage, the `UserProfile` model contains:
- `owner`: OneToOneField referencing the `User` model, establishing a direct link between the user and their profile.
- `created_on`, `updated_on`: Timestamps indicating when the profile was created and last updated.
- `name`, `email`: User's name and email information.
- `image`: An image field for storing the user's profile picture.

For the sake of time constraints, further development of the `UserProfile` model is planned for a later stage, indicating a commitment to continuous improvement and refinement of the user experience.

Below a textual representation of the relationship between models:

User Model:
One User can have many Cars (One-to-Many).
One User can send many Messages (One-to-Many).
One User can receive many Messages (One-to-Many).
One User has one UserProfile (One-to-One).

Car Model:
Many Cars belong to one User (Many-to-One).
One Car can be associated with many Messages (One-to-Many).

Message Model:
Many Messages are sent by one User (Many-to-One, as a sender).
Many Messages are received by one User (Many-to-One, as a receiver).
Many Messages can be associated with one Car (Many-to-One).

UserProfile Model:
One UserProfile is associated with one User (One-to-One).

## Testing

Testing and results can be found [here](/TESTING.md)

## Security Features and Defensive Design

### User Authentication

- Django's user authentication system is used to make sure that a user can sign up, sign in and sign out.

### Form Validation

If incorrect data is added to a form, the form won't submit and a warning will appear to the user informing them what field raised the error.

### Database Security

The database url and secret key are stored in the env.py. This was set up before the first push to Github.

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) tokens were used on all forms throughout this app.

## Features

The app starts from the "All Recipes" page which is the home page. From this page, the user can navigate to all the other pages present within this app. On top of each page is the logo. When it is clicked, it will open the home page.
In the navigation bar, the user is able to filter the recipes depending on the categories (All Recipes, Starters, Main Courses, Desserts and Other). He/she can also Sign up or Sign In.
The recipes are shown as cards with essential info provided on the pages All Recipes, Starters, Main Courses, Desserts and Other (Personal Recipe and Favourite Recipes when the user is signed in). More detailed info is provided on the recipe details page (one for each recipe) when the recipe's title is clicked on the recipe's card.
A user can Sign up and Sign in. Once he/she signs in, a My Profile page will be created with useful links to change password, create a recipe, to the personal recipe page (which is the page where the recipe created by the user will be stored) and to the favourite recipes page where the saved/bookmarked recipes will be stored.
While a user is signed in, he/she will be able to like, save/bookmark and comment on a recipe (features that are not allowed for a non-signed-in user).
A signed-in user will also be able to create, edit and delete his/her own recipes.
Signed-in users cannot edit and/or delete other's user recipes. If he/she tries to do it, a warning message is displayed.
